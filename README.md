# Alura Challenge

A challenge proposed by Alura to develop an app in 4 weeks. 

## Description  

The app is kind a clone of Netflix and Youtube I guess. I've used a lot of widgets, in this app. 

As you can see, in the Initial Screen, there is a Scaffold, the font family in app bar was changed as the background color.

In the body the first widget is an Image with a button that redirects to a video on Youtube.

Then a Row with multiple ElevatedButtons that is the categorys.

Then some videos. The logic behind it is a Container with a GestureDetector, when tapped redirects to the video on youtube. And a put an Image.network to show the image in Container. 

The Registration Screen has 3 TextFormField with validator and controller in wich one. And when add an Url image, automatic shows it.
